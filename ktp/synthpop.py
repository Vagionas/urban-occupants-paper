    """Hierarchical Iterative Proportional Fitting.

    Algorithm taken from
    MÃ¼ller and Axhausen 2011: "Hierarchical IPF: Generating a synthetic population for Switzerland"

    Can be used to fit a reference sample of households and individuals to control variables
    simultaneously. The algorithm supports only one dimensional control variables, and hence
    multi-dimensional control variables must be transformed to one dimensional ones first.

    Parameters:
        reference_sample:     The reference sample to be fited to the controls. Must be a pandas
                              DataFrame where the index is a multi index of (household_id,
                              person_id), and each colum represents either a household category
                              or a category of an individual.
        controls_individuals: The control variables for individuals. Must be a dict from control
                              name to a dict of its values.
                              e.g. {'age': {'below_50': 45, '50_or_older'}: 55}
        controls_households:  The control variables for households. Must be in the same format as
                              the controls for individuals.
        maxiter:              Maximum number of iterations.
