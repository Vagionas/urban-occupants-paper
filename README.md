# Working Paper KTP EECi & Improbable

This is the work in progress paper of the Knowledge Transfer Partnership between the Energy
Efficient Cities initiative (EECi) of University of Cambridge and Improbable.

See `./doc/main.md`.

## Run the analysis

To set up a environment in which the analysis can be run, the simplest is to use [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html). An environment with all dependencies can be created from the provided yaml file:

    conda env create -f conda-environment.yml

For the moment you will need to install [pytus2000](https;//github.com/timtroendle/pytus2000) manually.
